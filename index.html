				<p>Welcome to the Ori and the Will of the Wisps randomizer wiki!</p>
				<p>
					This is a mod for the PC version of Ori and the Will of the Wisps which changes the location of pickups.<br/>
					So when playing the randomizer you will probably find skills when picking up a spirit light container!<br/>
					This mod greatly improves the replayability of the game and is playable by anyone who already finished the game once.<br/>
					For more advanced players, harder difficulties will ask you to progress by using more advanced movement options or glitches.
				</p>
				<p>This wiki includes lots of information to help install the game, understand the options for seed generation, and learn about all the new things included in this mod.</p>

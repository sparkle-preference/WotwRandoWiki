					If you unequip Sentry, Blaze or Flash a bit after using it, you will get a bigger hop than usual. This will also remove all negatives effect of using these abilities as a movement option, which mainly allows to walljump right away. You can equip you ability again at any time after releasing your weapon wheel once.<br/>
					You can use the weapon wheel as a pause buffer. You want to unequip your ability when Ori starts to spread out after they rolled into a ball.</br>
					Sentry and Blaze will still consume energy even if you cancel it but doing it with Flash won't use any energy.

					You can also chain them together to gain a lot of height. Everytime you close your weapon wheel, you won't be able to use your ability for a bit of time so make sure to reequip it as soon as possible.

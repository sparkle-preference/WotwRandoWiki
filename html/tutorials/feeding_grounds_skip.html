				<p>Feeding ground have three different states:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Before doing cat and mouse</li>
					<li>After doing cat and mouse</li>
					<li>After getting Seir</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					After you get Seir, Shriek won’t be in Feeding Ground anymore which removes the kill plane from this area, letting you access Weeping Ridge and therefore Willow’s End. But there are multiple ways to bypass the kill plane, letting you adccess these areas without getting Seir.
				</p>
				<h2>After cat and mouse</h2>
				<p>
					If you already did cat and mouse, you want to enter the kill plane and wait until Shriek takes off to attack you. Then open your map and teleport to the nearby spirit well. If done correctly, Shriek won’t be at Feeding Ground anymore and the kill plane will be disabled.

				<h2>Before doing cat and mouse</h2>
				<p>
					This option is better because at the end of the cat and mouse section, boulders will block the path above the spirit well, which makes accessing Weeping Ridge harder if you don't have a lot of verticality options.<br/>
					Before explaining how to avoid the cat and mouse sequence (and therefore the kill plane), you need to understand how to trigger it in the first place.<br/>
					There are two main triggers. The first one is at the location where Ori is. This trigger will prevent you from doing anything else than moving to the right if you touch the ground here. The second one will trigger when Ori walks on the bone in the red circle, which starts the actual cat and mouse. So, to avoid the cat and mouse section, you want to avoid touching these bones.

				<p>To do so, you can use Burrow to pass under it.</p>

				<p>
					You can also pass over it with your aerial mobility. As long as you land further than these bones, you will be able to move freely in Feeding Ground. However, be careful: at Ori’s position in the first screenshot, you won’t be able to your abilities so make sure to have enough height so you can pass through that first trigger without touching the ground.<br/>
					This can be done with Launch from the ground

				<p>
					But if you don't have Launch, you will have to rely on glide, jumps and dash. You can hit the skulls on the ground with your sword in order to [reset your aerial options](https://github.com/sparkle-preference/OriWotwRandomizerClient/wiki/Resetting-aerial-options).

					The randomizer also adds the possibility to play with other players! To play a multiplayer game, you will need to log in to <a href='https://wotw.orirando.com/'>this website</a>.<br/>
					The connection uses <a href='https://discord.com/'>Discord</a> so please download it if you don't already have it.
				</p>
				<p>
					After login in, you will be able to create bingos and coop games.<br/>
					To make it work, you will have to <a href='/WotwRandoWiki/html/seed_generation.html'>generate a seed</a> with the 'Enable Netcode' option activated.<br/>
					If it is still not working, you might have disabled the netcode in the randomizer <a href='/WotwRandoWiki/html/settings.html'>settings</a>.
				</p>
				<h2>Bingo</h2>
				<p>
					To create a bingo game, simply click the New Bingo Game button after you have logged in. It will generate a board with 25 random in-game goals like collecting pickups from trees, spending spirit light or completing quests. Once the board is generated, click the Join button to enter the game. You can send the URL of your board to other players if you want to play with others (they will have to click the Join button as well). Your progress will be autotracked. You can click on a playerâ€™s name to display their progress on the board.
				</p>
				<h3>Discovery bingo</h3>
				<p>
					If you click on the New Discovery Bingo Game button, you will use a variant of bingo where most goals will be hidden at first. This is the same as a normal bingo except that only 2 goals will be displayed from the 25 goals. When you complete one goal, the goal adjacent to the one you finished will be revealed. The autotracker will keep track of your progress towards hidden goals but they won't count as completed until you unlock them by completing a goal adjacent to them. When a completed goal is revealed, it will be marked as completed immediately and its adjacent goals will be revealed as well.
				</p>
				<h3>Lockout bingo</h3>
				<p>
					If you click on the New Lockout Bingo Game button, you will use a variant of bingo where you can't validate a goal if another player already validated it. Since it's pretty hard to complete lines in this variant, the goal is to have more validated goals than the other players and not to form lines. This is usually played in 1 versus 1 so the first player which validate 13 goals from the 25 available win the game.
				</p>
				<h2>Coop</h2>
				<p>
					To create a coop game, click the 'New Coop Game' button and then click the 'Join game on new team' button, share your URL to the others players.<br/>
					They will be able to either enter the same team as yourself by clicking the 'Join' button next to your name or create a new team by clicking the same button as you did.<br/>
					The page won't refresh itself when other players join or create teams so you'll need to refresh the page manually if you want to see a new change.<br/>
					Cooperative games share pickups so if a player from your team collects a pickup, you will get the item your team mate collected and the pickup will disappear from your game.<br/>
					This mode also shares game states so for example if your teammate opened the second room of wellspring, it will be opened for you as well.

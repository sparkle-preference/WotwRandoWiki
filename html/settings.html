					To open the settings, launch RandoSettings.exe. This will open a window with a bunch of options which you can check to enable:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Cursor lock: Locks the cursor in the game window, which prevents the mouse from moving off screen. Useful if you are playing in windowed display mode or with multiple screens.</li>
					<li>Invert Swim Speeds: In the vanilla game, holding the jump button makes Ori swims faster. With this option, Ori will be swimming at maximum speed by default and will be slowing down when holding your jump button.</li>
					<li>Disable Quests Snap on Mouseover: In the vanilla game, if you are hovering over a quest on the quest list next to the map, the game will scroll to the location of this quest. With this option, the game will require you to press your 3rd ability button (the bottom left one in the game UI) in order to scroll the map to the quest location instead of simply hovering the quest's name.</li>
					<li>Disable Debug Controls: Disable the debug functionalities when playing the randomizer if you have them enabled. You can still toggle the debug mode while playing the randomizer by pressing Ctrl+Alt+D</li>
					<li>Mouse Aiming Grapple: In the vanilla game, if you want to use grapple on something, you need to hold the direction toward this object to grapple it. With this enabled, you will be aiming with the mouse rather than with your directional inputs.</li>
					<li>Mouse Aiming Burrow: In the vanilla game, when using burrow you control Ori by using your directional inputs. With this option, you will control Ori's movement with your mouse which lets you move in 360° rather than being limited to the 4 directions of your keyboard.</li>
					<li>Mouse Aiming Water Dash: In the vanilla game, when using water dash you control Ori by using your directional inputs. With this option, you will control Ori's movement with your mouse which lets you move in 360° rather than being limited to the 4 directions of your keyboard.</li>
					<li>Hide Quest Filter: Hide the quest filter which show you only the quests location on your map</li>
					<li>Hide Warp Filter: Hide the warp filter which show you only the warps location on your map</li>
					<li>Hide Collectable Filter: Hide the collectable filter which show you only the remaining collectables location on your map</li>
					<li>Always Show Warps: Always show the warps location on your map, no matter which filter you are using</li>
					<li>Restore Short Cutscenes: Enable the short and unskippable cutscenes from the vanilla game which are removed by the randomizer</li>
					<li>Restore Long Cutscenes: Enable the long and unskippable cutscenes from the vanilla game which are removed by the randomizer</li>
					<li>Launch with Item Tracker: Automatically open the item tracker when launching the randomizer</li>
					<li>Automatic Updates: Allows the randomizer to check for new updates on launch</li>
					<li>Beta Versions: Allows the randomizer to update to beta versions in need of testing</li>
					<li>Disable Netcode: Prevents the randomizer from communicating with the rando server. With this option checked, bingo auto tracking and other netcode features like coop games will be unavailable</li>
					<li>Use Windows Store: Launch the randomizer using Windows Store instead of Steam</li>
					<li>Steam path: The path to your Steam execution file. If you own the Steam version of the game instead of the Windows Store one, make sure this path is correct. You can change it by pressing the _Change Steam Path_ button.</li>

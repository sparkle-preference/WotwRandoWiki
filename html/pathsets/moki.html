					The Moki <a href="/WotwRandoWiki/html/logic_groups.html">logic group</a> is designed for players who have finished the game at least once. A moki seed does not require any particular requirement as long as you know how to use the skill set of Ori. The logic can ask you to use these skills, individually or in combination:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Double jump, grapple, dash, water dash, burrow and launch for movement</li>
					<li>Bash for movement and redirection of projectiles</li>
					<li>Bashing Grenade's projectile for vertical movement</li>
					<li>Grenade to melt ice, change the state in Baur and activating lanterns</li>
					<li>Flap for activating the soups in Baur, changing the state in Baur, collecting items under leaves pile and activating wind current</li>
					<li>Glide for both horizontal movement and gliding in wind current</li>
					<li>Flash to go through darkness in Depths</li>
					<li>Hammer or Spear to break breakable floors and ceilings</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In this difficulty, the logic expects you to have found Regenerate and have enough HP to enter Woods, Pools, Depths, Baur, Wastes and Willow. Woods, Pools, Depths and Baur require at least 4.5 HP, Wastes requires at least 5.5 HP and Willow requires 6.5 HP. Regenerate is also expected for combat shrines, arenas and boss fights.

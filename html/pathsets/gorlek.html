					The Gorlek <a href="../logic_groups.html">logic group</a> is for more advanced players. In this difficulty, more precise utilisation of skills are required. These options are added to the logic:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Paths that would be possible with <a href="moki.html">Moki's</a> rules but are either not obvious or too tricky to execute for Moki target players</li>
					<li>Connection that are not obvious for <a href="moki.html">Moki's</a> player because the camera isn't showing a pickup</li>
					<li>Bashing Grenade's projectile for horizontal movement</li>
					<li>One damage boost per path, regardless of the amount of damage (taking one damage which reduce your health by 3 would be in logic but taking two damages which each reduce your health by 1 is not in logic despite the fact that you took less damage)</li>
					<li><a href="../tutorials/weapon_movement.html">Use sword or hammer aerial combo in order to hover</a></li>
					<li><a href="../tutorials/weapon_movement.html">Use sword or hammer up attack for extra height</a></li>
					<li>Using the Triple Jump shard</li>
					<li>Bow to go through darkness in Depths</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The logic expects you to have found Regenerate to enter Woods, Pools, Depths, Baur, Wastes and Willow but unlike in <a href="moki.html">Moki</a>, there is no HP requirement to enter these areas in Gorlek. Regenerate is still expected for boss fights, arenas and combat shrines.
